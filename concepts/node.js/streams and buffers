// What are streams in Node.js?
// Streams are objects that enable you to read data or write data continuously.

// There are four types of streams:

// Readable – Used for reading operations

// Writable − Used for write operations

// Duplex − Can be used for both reading and write operations

// Transform − A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input

// What is the buffer class in Node.js?
// Buffer class stores raw data similar to an array of integers but corresponds to a raw memory allocation outside the V8 heap. 
// Buffer class is used because pure JavaScript is not compatible with binary data
