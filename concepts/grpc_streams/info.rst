gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Calls) is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework developed by Google. 
It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as the interface description language, and provides features such 
as authentication, load balancing, and more. 
One of its powerful features is the ability to handle streams, allowing for efficient communication between client and server 
in real-time or near-real-time scenarios.

Types of gRPC Streams
Unary RPC:
The client sends a single request to the server and receives a single response.
This is the simplest form of RPC and is not considered streaming.

Server Streaming RPC:
The client sends a single request to the server and receives a stream of responses.
The client reads from the returned stream of responses until there are no more messages.

Client Streaming RPC:
The client sends a stream of requests to the server.
The server processes the stream of requests and sends back a single response once the client has finished sending the stream.

Bidirectional Streaming RPC:
Both the client and the server send a stream of messages.
The two streams operate independently, so the client and server can read and write in any order.
This is the most flexible type of streaming and can be used for complex real-time communication scenarios.

Example Use Cases
Real-time Chat Applications: Using bidirectional streaming to allow real-time message exchange between users.
Live Data Feeds: Using server streaming to send real-time updates to clients (e.g., stock prices, sports scores).
File Uploads: Using client streaming to send large files in chunks from client to server.
Interactive Applications: Combining client and server streaming to create interactive applications such as online gaming or collaborative tools.
