Ambassdor
 - it acts as a "go-between" for your app and the services it communicates with offloading tasks such as logging/monitoing/handling retries
 - K8s uses envoy as ambassdor to simplify communication between services
 - this pattern can help reduce latency, enhanced security and improve overall architecture of distributed system

Circuit Breaker
 - 

Command Query responsibility seggregation
 - by separating the write or command and read or query operations
 - command -> write DB query -> read DB

Event Sourcing 
 - instead of updating a record directly, we store events representing changes
 - this approach provides complete history of a system and enables better auditing and debugging

Leader Election
 - one node is responsible for specific task or resource
 - when leader node fails then remaining nodes elects new leader

Pub Sub

Sharding
 - technique to distribute data across multiple nodes in a system
 - each shard contains subset of a data, reducing the load on any single node
 - it can help achieve better data locality, reducing network latency and speed up query execution

Strangular Fig Pattern
 - migrate legacy to new version
