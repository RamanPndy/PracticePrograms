Understanding the Differences Between RabbitMQ vs Kafka

Performance:
RabbitMQ process 4K-10K messages per second
Kafka process 1 million messages per second

Message Retention
RabbitMQ : Acknowledgment based
Kafka: Policy-based (e.g., 30 days)

Data Type
RabbitMQ: Transactional
Kafka: Operational

Consumer Mode
RabbitMQ: Smart broker/dumb consumer
Kafka: Dumb broker/smart consumer

Topology
RabbitMQ: Exchange type: Direct, Fan out, Topic, Header-based. uses the exchange queue topology — sending messages to an exchange where they are in turn routed to various queue bindings for the consumer’s use.
Kafka: Publish/subscribe based. sending messages across the stream to the correct topics, and then consumed by users in the different authorized groups.

Payload Size
RabbitMQ: No constraints
Kafka: Default 1MB limit

Usage Cases
RabbitMQ: Simple use cases
Kafka: Massive data/high throughput cases

Data Flow
RabbitMQ: it uses a distinct, bounded data flow. Messages are created and sent by the producer and received by the consumer.
Kafka: it uses an unbounded data flow, with the key-value pairs continuously streaming to the assigned topic.

Data Usage
RabbitMQ: It is best for transactional data, such as order formation and placement, and user requests.
Kafka: It is best with operational data like process operations, auditing and logging statistics, and system activity.

Messaging
RabbitMQ: sends messages to users. These messages are removed from the queue once they are processed and acknowledged.
Kafka: It uses continuous messages, which stay in the queue until the retention time expires.

Design Model
RabbitMQ: It employs the smart broker/dumb consumer model. The broker consistently delivers messages to consumers and keeps track of their status.
Kafka: It uses the dumb broker/smart consumer model. Kafka doesn’t monitor the messages each user has read. Rather, it retains unread messages only, preserving all messages for a set amount of time. Consumers must monitor their position in each log.

Architecture Differences
RabbitMQ:
The components of RabbitMQ’s Architecture consist of the following:

Queue: It is in charge of keeping track of messages that have been received and may have configuration data that specifies what it can do with a message.
Exchange: An exchange receives messages sent to RabbitMQ and determines where they should be forwarded. Exchanges define the routing strategies that are used for messages, most frequently by examining the data characteristics that are transmitted with the message or included inside its attributes.
Producer: Produces messages and sends them to a broker server (publishes). A payload and a label are the two components of a message. The user's desired data to convey is the payload. The label specifies who should receive a copy of the message and describes the payload.
Consumer: It subscribes to a queue and is connected to a broker server. 
Broker: Applications can exchange information and communicate with one another through a broker.
Binding: It tells an exchange which queues to distribute messages. Additionally, the binding will instruct the exchange to filter which messages it is permitted to add to a queue for specific exchange types.

Kafka:
Mirror Maker: One of the most crucial elements of Kafka is replication, which makes sure that messages are published and consumed even in the event that the broker encounters a problem.
ZooKeeper: Acts as a liaison between the consumers and the Kafka broker. It maintains coordination data such as configuration, location, and status details.
Producer: Producers push or publish messages to a Kafka topic created on a Kafka broker. Producers also have the option of sending messages to a broker in a synchronous or asynchronous manner.
Consumers: Individuals who subscribe to a Kafka topic and pull messages from it. Kafka By default, consumers store messages in ZooKeeper. However, Kafka also allows data to be stored in additional storage platforms used by programs for online transaction processing (OLTP).
Broker: Acts as a Kafka server, or broker. The number of partitions for each message is defined in accordance with the order in which the messages are stored by the broker.

Scalability and Redundancy
RabbitMQ: It uses a round-robin queue to repeat messages. To boost throughput and balance the load, the messages are divided among the queues. Additionally, it enables numerous consumers to read messages from various queues at once.
Kafka: Scalability and redundancy are provided by Kafka partitions. The partition was duplicated across numerous brokers. In the event that one of the brokers fails, the customer can still be served by another broker.

Message Consumption
RabbitMQ: A message must be delivered to the customer by one of RabbitMQ's brokers, and these messages are transmitted in batches.
Kafka: Kafka Consumers read a message from the broker and keep the queue counter offset trackable. As soon as the message is read, the offset is increased.

Message Priority
RabbitMQ: Messages can be given priority with the help of a priority queue in RabbitMQ.
Kafka: all messages have the same priority, which cannot be altered.

Sequential Ordering
RabbitMQ: The order of the messages in the broker's queue is maintained by RabbitMQ.
Kafka: Topics are used by Kafka to distinguish between messages, and Zookeeper keeps track of the offset so that it may be used by any consumer who wishes to read a topic.

Pull vs Push Approach
The push mechanism of RabbitMQ prevents the consumer from being aware of any message retrieval. The Broker makes sure the customer receives the message.

Additionally, it returns an acknowledgment after processing the data to make sure messages reach the customer. When there is a negative response, the message is sent once more by being added to the queue.

Kafka provides a pull mechanism that enables clients to request data in batches from the broker. Smartly, the consumer keeps a tab on the offset of the most recent message encounter. By employing offset, it arranges the data in the partitions' order.

Delivery Guarantee
RabbitMQ: Especially in relation to transactions utilizing a single queue, it does not guarantee atomicity.
Kafka: Only keeps order within a partition. Kafka ensures that every message in a partition either succeeds or fails.

Message ordering
RabbitMQ: Unsupported
Kafka: Message ordering is provided via its partitioning. By message key, messages are sent to topics.

Message priorities
RabbitMQ: You can set message priorities in RabbitMQ and consume messages in the order of highest priority.
Kafka: Unavailable

Message lifetime
RabbitMQ: Because RabbitMQ is a queue, messages are discarded after being read, and an acknowledgment is given.
Kafka: Since Kafka is a log, messages are kept on file by default. This can be controlled by defining a retention policy.

Features
RabbitMQ:
Reliability: Key characteristics of RabbitMQ that have an immediate influence on performance include persistence, delivery feedback, publisher confirmations, and high availability.
Built-in Clustering: The clustering in RabbitMQ was created with two objectives in mind. It still enables the consumers and producers to continue operating in the event that one node fails, expanding messaging throughput linearly by adding new nodes.
Security: It is offered by RabbitMQ at different levels. Secure client connections can be achieved by requiring Client Certificate Checking and SSL-only communication. The virtual host may have user access controls to ensure high-level message isolation.
Flexible Routing: For routing, RabbitMQ comes with a number of built-in exchange kinds. Messages are often routed through exchanges before they reach queues in conventional routing. Users can also tie exchanges together for complicated routing or even develop their exchange type as a plugin.

Kafka:
Distributed event streaming platform: Kafka enables per-partition ordering semantics while facilitating message partitioning between Kafka servers and dispersing consumption over a cluster of consumer systems.
High Throughput: Kafka was built to process millions of messages per second and handle massive amounts of data.
Real-time solutions: Consumer threads should have immediate access to messages produced by producer threads.
Persistent Messaging: In order to truly benefit from big data, no kind of information loss may be accepted. O(1) Disc Structures, which are used in the construction of Apache Kafka, provide constant-time performance even with extremely large message storage densities (in the TBs). In event-based systems like Complex Event Processing, this quality is crucial (CEP).

Use Cases
RabbitMQ:
Complex Routing – if you want to route messages among many consuming apps like in a microservices architecture, RabbitMQ can be your best choice. RabbitMQ consistent hash exchange can balance load processing across a distributed monitoring service.  You can also use alternate exchanges to route specific portion of events to specific services for A/B testing. 
Legacy Applications – another use case of RabbitMQ is to deploy it using available plugins (or building your own plugin) for connecting consumer apps to legacy apps. For example, communicate with JMS apps using Java Message Service (JMS) plug-in and JMS client library. 

Kafka:
Tracking High-throughput Activity – you can use Kafka for different high volume, high throughput activity tracking like tracking website activity, ingesting data from IoT sensors, keeping tabs on shipments, monitoring patients in hospitals, etc. 
Stream Processing – Use Kafka to implement application logic based on streams of events. For example, for an event lasting for several minutes, you can track average value over the duration of the event or keep a running count of the types of events. 
Event Sourcing – Kafka supports event sourcing, wherein any changes to an app state are stored in the form of sequence of events. For example, while using Kafka for a banking app, if the account balance gets corrupted somehow, you can use the stored history of transactions to recalculate the balance. 
Log aggregation – Kafka can also be used to collect log files and store them in a centralized location.
