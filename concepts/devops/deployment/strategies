Blue/Green deployment := In blue-green deployment you serve the current app on one half of your environment (Blue) and deploy your new application to the other (Green) without affecting the blue environment.
canary deployment := canary deployment is the practice of making staged releases. We roll out a software update to a small part of the users first, so they may test it and provide feedback. Once the change is accepted, the update is rolled out to the rest of the users.
 - running two versions of app simultaneously (the stable and the canary)
 - deploying updates (rolling and side by side)
    - side by side deployment : create a whole new environment and install canary version there
we can use canary deployment for A/B testing
capacity tests
valueable feedback from users
no downtime
in canary can deploy by region ie. to specific geographical area
cons
    - cost
    - complexity
    - time
