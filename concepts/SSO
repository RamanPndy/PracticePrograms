with SSO, use can acess many apps without having login each time
SSO is built on concept of federated identity
it enables sharing of identity information across trusted but independent systems
protocols for authentication process (SAML (Security assertion markup language) and OpenID connect)
SAML uses XML whereas OpenId connect usess JWT (Header, Payload and Signature)

SAML steps:
    - Gmail is a service provider
    - Gmail server detects that user from work domain and returns SAML authentication request to browser
    - browser redirect users to identity provider (Okta, Auth0, Onelogin) for the company specified in the SAML authentication request
    - identity provider shows login page where user enters credentials
    - once user is authenticated then identity provider generates a SAML response (SAML assertion) and return that to browser
    - SAML assertion is a cryptographically signed XML documents which contains information about the user and what the user can acess with service provider
    - browser forwards signed SAML assertion to the service provider
    - service provider validates that the assertion was signed by the identity provider 
    - this validation is usually done with public key cryptography
    - service provider returns protected resource to the browser based on what the user is allowed to access as specified in SAML assertion
    - if user is already logged in with the identity provider, it skips the login process, and instead generates a SAML assertion for service provider detailing what the user can access there
