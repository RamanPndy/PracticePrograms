In Go, the garbage collector (GC) is responsible for automatically managing memory allocation and deallocation. It helps prevent memory leaks and allows developers to focus on writing code without constantly worrying about memory management. Go's garbage collector is designed to be efficient and work with minimal impact on the application's performance.

Here's a high-level overview of how the garbage collector works in Go:

1. **Memory Allocation**: In Go, memory allocation is performed using the `new` and `make` keywords, as well as other memory allocation operations provided by the standard library. When memory is allocated, it is tracked by the garbage collector.

2. **Heap and Stack**: Go has a stack and a heap for managing memory. Local variables are typically stored on the stack, and their memory is automatically reclaimed when the function they're in exits. Larger and dynamically allocated data, like structs created using `new` or slices created with `make`, are allocated on the heap.

3. **Mark and Sweep Algorithm**: Go's garbage collector uses a "mark and sweep" algorithm to identify and collect unreachable objects. Here's how it works:

   - **Mark Phase**: The garbage collector starts from a set of "roots," which includes global variables, function arguments, and other pointers that are directly accessible by the program. It traverses through these objects, marking each one as reachable.
   
   - **Tracing Reachable Objects**: Starting from the roots, the GC traces through all the pointers and objects reachable from them. It marks these objects as reachable as well. This process continues recursively until all reachable objects are marked.

   - **Sweep Phase**: After marking all reachable objects, the garbage collector sweeps through the entire heap, reclaiming memory from objects that were not marked as reachable. These unmarked objects are considered garbage and are deallocated.

4. **Concurrent and Parallel**: Go's garbage collector is designed to run concurrently with your application. It uses a technique called "concurrent garbage collection" to minimize pauses. This means that while the garbage collection is ongoing, your application can continue running, resulting in shorter and less noticeable pauses.

5. **Tuning and Control**: Go provides environment variables and options to control the behavior of the garbage collector. This allows developers to adjust settings based on their application's specific requirements. For example, you can set parameters like the GC target pause time or the number of concurrent workers used during collection.

6. **Performance Considerations**: While Go's garbage collector is quite efficient, it's important to be mindful of memory allocation patterns in your code. Frequent and unnecessary allocations can lead to increased garbage collection overhead. Using object pools, reusing memory, and optimizing data structures can help minimize memory churn and improve performance.

In summary, Go's garbage collector operates behind the scenes to manage memory allocation and deallocation, helping developers avoid memory leaks and manual memory management headaches. It uses a mark and sweep algorithm, operates concurrently with your application, and provides options for tuning its behavior to suit your application's needs.
