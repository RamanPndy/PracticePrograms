Redis uses various mechanisms to maintain concurrency and ensure data consistency in a distributed system. 
Here are some key strategies and tools employed by Redis:

Single-threaded Architecture:
Redis processes commands in a single-threaded manner, which simplifies concurrency control by avoiding the complexities of 
multi-threaded access to data structures. 
This design ensures that only one command manipulates the data at any given time.

Optimistic Locking:
Redis provides the WATCH command, which implements optimistic locking. 
When a key is watched, Redis tracks changes to that key. 
If the key is modified by another client between the WATCH and EXEC commands, the transaction is aborted. 
This approach is useful for scenarios where the data is expected to change infrequently.

Atomic Operations:
Redis commands are atomic, meaning they are executed completely or not at all. 
This atomicity is crucial for maintaining data consistency, especially in operations involving multiple keys or 
complex data manipulations.

Distributed Locks:
Redis supports distributed locks using the SET command with the NX and PX options (SET key value NX PX milliseconds). 
These options ensure that the lock is set only if the key does not already exist, and the lock automatically expires after a 
specified timeout. 
The Redlock algorithm is a popular distributed locking mechanism implemented using Redis.

Cluster Mode:
In a Redis cluster, data is partitioned across multiple nodes. 
Each node is responsible for a subset of the data, and clients interact with the appropriate node based on the keyâ€™s hash slot. 
This partitioning helps manage concurrency by distributing the load and reducing contention on individual nodes.

Replication and Sentinel:
Redis supports master-slave replication, where writes are directed to the master, and reads can be distributed across replicas. 
This replication model helps distribute read load and provides failover capabilities through Redis Sentinel, which monitors 
master nodes and promotes slaves to masters in case of failure.

Pipelining:
Redis allows clients to send multiple commands in a single network request using pipelining. 
While this does not directly impact concurrency control, it reduces the round-trip time and improves performance by batching 
commands, thus indirectly helping with concurrency by reducing the load on the server.
