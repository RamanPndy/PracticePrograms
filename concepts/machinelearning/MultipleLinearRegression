Given a multiple linear regression, how will you identify if there is non-linearity present in the data?
Residual Plots:
Plot the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) against the predicted values or each predictor variable.
If the residuals show a pattern (such as a curve) rather than being randomly scattered, it suggests that there may be non-linearity in the data.

Added Variable Plots (Partial Regression Plots):
These plots show the relationship between the response variable and a particular predictor, after accounting for the effects of all other predictors.
Non-linearity may be evident if the added variable plot displays a pattern or curve.

Polynomial Features:
Fit polynomial features (e.g., quadratic or cubic terms) and check if they significantly improve the model.
Significant improvement suggests that non-linearity might be present.

Non-Parametric Methods:
Use non-parametric methods like Local Regression (LOESS) or Kernel Regression to model the relationship and check if the model improves or shows a different pattern compared to the linear regression.

Visual Inspection:
Plot the relationship between the response variable and each predictor variable.
If the scatter plot shows a non-linear pattern (e.g., exponential, logarithmic, or sinusoidal), it indicates possible non-linearity.

Transformation and Interaction Terms:
Experiment with transformations (e.g., log, square root) and interaction terms in your model.
Significant improvements or changes in the model's performance may indicate that non-linearity was present and addressed.

We assess the appropriateness of the data transformation by checking the residual plots for any violations of assumptions.
The residual plots help determine whether the assumptions of linear regression are met, including:
Linearity: Residuals should have no discernible pattern.
Homoscedasticity: Residuals should have constant variance.
Independence: Residuals should be independent.
Normality: Residuals should be approximately normally distributed.
If the residuals after transformation show no patterns and meet these assumptions, it indicates that the data transformation was appropriate.
