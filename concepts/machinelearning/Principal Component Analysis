Multicollinearity
1. Multicollinearity generally occurs when there are high correlations between two or more predictor variables.
2. In the case of multicollinearity, some of the predictor variables can be used to predict some other predictor variables.
3. An easy way to detect multicollinearity is to calculate correlation coefficients for all combinations of predictor variables.
4. Multicollinearity leads to incorrect estimates of the model parameters. Hence, never helps in a better convergence.

Principal Component Analysis
It is an unsupervised technique
Principal components are the linear combinations of original variables
Principal components are constructed to capture the maximum information
PCA helps in solving the multicollinearity problem by creating new uncorrelated features which are used as input for the predictive model.
With a dimensionality reduction technique like PCA, you convert a dataset having N dimensions to another dataset having k dimensions where N > k.

PCA can help to solve curse of dimensionality.
