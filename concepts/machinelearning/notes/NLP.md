<p>The frequency of words in any large enough document (assume a document of more than, say, a million words) is best approximated by which distribution:</p>
The frequency of words in a large enough document is best approximated by the **Zipf's Law distribution**, which is a power-law distribution.

### Key Characteristics:
1. **Zipf's Law**:  
   - The frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.  
   - For example, the most frequent word appears roughly twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, and so on.

2. **Implication for Language**:  
   - A small number of words (e.g., articles like "the," "of," "and") occur very frequently, while the majority of words appear rarely.  
   - This reflects the natural structure of language and is consistent across different languages and corpora.

3. **Formula**:  
   \[
   f(r) \propto \frac{1}{r^a}
   \]
   - \(f(r)\): frequency of the word  
   - \(r\): rank of the word  
   - \(a\): exponent (usually close to 1 in natural languages)

### Why Zipf's Law?  
   - It arises naturally in many human and natural systems due to preferential attachment or rich-get-richer dynamics (frequently used words become even more frequent).

### Application in Text Analysis:
   - Recognizing this distribution helps optimize natural language processing techniques, such as stop-word removal and weighting schemes like TF-IDF.

<p>Which of the following words is not a stop word in the English language according to the NLTK’s English stopwords? <br>I Has Yes Was</p>
In order to identify which word is **not** a stop word according to NLTK's English stopwords list, you can check against common stop words like "the," "is," "in," "and," etc., which are typically removed during text processing tasks. Words that carry specific meaning (e.g., **"apple"** or **"run"**) are usually **not** stop words.

Here's an example of how to check a word against the NLTK stopwords list:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

# Ensure stopwords are downloaded
nltk.download('stopwords')

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

# Check if a word is a stopword
word = "apple"  # Replace with the word you want to check
print(word in stop_words)
```

If the word returns `False`, it means that it is **not** a stop word.

For example:
- "apple" is **not** a stop word.
- "the" is a stop word.

<b>Ans :</b>Yes<br>
<b>Explaination :</b>The word ‘yes’ isn't a stop word.

<p>Which of the following words can’t be reduced to its base form by a stemmer: <br>
Bashed, Successful, Worse, Sweeping</p>
<b>Ans :</b>Worse<br>
<b>Explaination :</b>The base form of the word ‘worse’ is ‘bad’. ‘Worse’ can’t be reduced to ‘bad’ using a stemmer.
<hr>

<p>What is the rationale behind the concept of inverse document frequency to capture word importance?</p>
<b>Ans :</b>If a term appears only in a select few documents, it is considered as important.<br>
<b>Explaination :</b>The idea behind including the inverse document frequency was to get a holistic view of the word importance based on looking at the presence of the words in other documents too, rather than just looking at its presence in the current document.

To calculate the Soundex code of the word **‘UpGrad’**, follow the Soundex rules:

1. The first letter of the word is retained as it is.
2. The remaining letters are encoded based on a predefined mapping.
3. Letters that have the same Soundex code are not duplicated.
4. Only the first three digits of the code are retained (if there are fewer than three digits, zeros are added).

**Soundex Mapping:**

- U, A, E, I, O, U = 0
- B, F, P, V = 1
- C, G, J, K, Q, S, X, Z = 2
- D, T = 3
- L = 4
- M, N = 5
- R = 6

### Step-by-Step Calculation for **‘UpGrad’**:

1. **U** → Keep 'U' as it is (first letter).
2. **p** → 'P' maps to **1**.
3. **G** → 'G' maps to **2**.
4. **r** → 'R' maps to **6**.
5. **a** → 'A' maps to **0**.
6. **d** → 'D' maps to **3**.

Now we form the Soundex code:

- Keep the first letter 'U'.
- After the first letter, the sequence becomes: 1, 2, 6, 0, 3.
- Remove any duplicates: **1, 2, 6, 0, 3**.
- Only the first three digits are kept: **1, 2, 6**.

Finally, the Soundex code for **‘UpGrad’** is: **U126**.
