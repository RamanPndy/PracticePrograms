<h3>p-value Method</h3>
<p>Suppose you conduct a hypothesis test and observe that the values of the sample mean and sample standard deviation when n = 25 do not lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis. You calculate the p-value as 0.0667. What would happen to the p-value if you observe the same sample mean and sample standard deviation for a larger sample size, say greater than 50?</p>
<b>Ans :</b>Decrease<br>
<b>Explaination :</b>With an increase in the sample size, the denominator of the z-score decreases, and thus the absolute value of Z-score increases, which means that the sample mean would move away from the central tendency towards the tails. This means that the p-value would actually decrease. Conceptually, Increasing the sample size will make the distribution of sample means narrower, and chance of sample mean falling in the critical region decreases. So p-value will decrease.

<h3>Types of errors</h3>
<p>Consider the null hypothesis that a process produces no more than the maximum permissible rate of defective items. In this situation, a type-II error would be:</p>
<b>Ans :</b>To conclude that the process does not produce more than the maximum permissible rate of defective items, when it actually does<br>
<b>Explaination :</b>Type-II error means not rejecting the incorrect null hypothesis. So, a type-II error would signify that the null hypothesis is actually incorrect, i.e. the process actually produces more than the maximum permissible rate of defective items, but you fail to reject it, i.e. you think it does not produce more than the maximum permissible rate of defective items.

<p>A test to screen for a serious but curable disease is similar to hypothesis testing. In this instance, the null hypothesis would be that the person does not have the disease, and the alternate hypothesis would be that the person has the disease. If the null hypothesis is rejected, it means that the disease is detected and treatment will be provided to the particular patient. Otherwise, it will not. Assuming the treatment does not have serious side effects, in this scenario, it is better to increase the probability of:</p>
<b>Ans :</b>Making a type-I error, i.e. providing treatment when it is not needed<br>
<b>Explaination :</b>Here, type-I error would be providing treatment upon detecting the disease, when the person does not actually have the disease. And type-II error would be not providing treatment upon failing to detect the disease, when the person actually has the disease. Since the treatment has no serious side effects, type-I error poses a lower health risk than type-II error, as not providing treatment to a person who actually has the disease would increase his/her health risk.

<h3>Types of hypotheses</h3>
<p>The null and alternative hypotheses are statements about:</p>
<b>Ans :</b>Population parameters<br>
<b>Explaination :</b>The hypothesis is always made about the population parameters. The sample parameters are only used as evidence to test the hypothesis.

<h3>Null and Alternate Hypotheses</h3>
<p>A house owner claims that the current market value of his house is at least Rs.40,00,000.  60 real estate agents are asked independently to estimate the house's value. The hypothesis test that is conducted ends with the decision of "reject H₀".  Which of the following statements accurately states the conclusion?</p>
<b>Ans :</b>The house owner is wrong, the house is worth less than Rs. 40,00,000<br>
<b>Explaination :</b>Rejection of the null hypothesis means rejection of the status quo or the earlier assumption of the house owner that his house is worth at least Rs. 40,00,000. As the null hypothesis is H₀: House market value ≥ 40,00,000, the alternate hypothesis would be opposite of that.
<hr>

<p>Which of the following options hold true for null hypothesis?</p>
<b>Ans :</b>
<ul>
<li>The claim with the “less than or equal to” sign<br>
The null hypothesis is always written with the “equal to” or “less than or equal to” or “more than or equal to” sign.
<li>The claim with the “equal to” sign<br>
The null hypothesis is always written with the “equal to” or “less than or equal to” or “more than or equal to” sign.

<p>Cadbury states that the average weight of one of its chocolate products ‘Dairy Milk Silk’ is 60 g. As an analyst on the internal Quality Assurance team, you would like to test whether, at the 2% significance level, the average weight is 60 g or not. A sample of 100 chocolates is collected and the sample mean size is calculated to be 62.6 g. The standard deviation, as calculated from the sample, is 10.7 g.</p>
<h3>Critical Value Method</h3>
<p>What would be the Zc for the critical point/s in this case?</p>
<b>Ans :</b>2.33<br>
<b>Explaination :</b>For a 2% significance level, you would have two critical regions on both sides with a total area of 0.02 (because you want to test if the average weight of the chocolate is greater than or less than 60 g). So, the area of the critical region on the right side would be 0.01, which means that the area till UCV (cumulative probability of that point) would be 1 - 0.01 = 0.99. So, you need to find the z-value of 0.99. The z-score for 0.9901 in the z-table is 2.33 (2.3 on the horizontal axis and 0.03 on the vertical axis). So, you can take the z-score for either 0.9901 for 0.99.

<p>Find out the critical values for this test and conclude whether the QA team can safely pass this test or not.</p>
<b>Ans :</b>UCV = 62.49 g, LCV = 57.51 g and Result = Don’t pass the test<br>
<b>Explaination :</b>The critical values can be calculated from μ ± Zc x (σ/​√N​) as 60g ± 2.33(10.7 /√100) = 60g ± 2.49g which comes out to be 62.49 g and 57.51 g. Since 62.6 g is greater than the UVC of 62.49, which means the sample mean lies outside the range of the critical values, you reject the null hypothesis that the average weight of the chocolate is 60 g. So, the QA would not pass this test.
