A data warehouse is a collection of data. It demonstrates the following properties:

Subject-oriented: A data warehouse should contain information about a few well-defined subjects rather than the enterprise.
Integrated: A data warehouse is an integrated repository of data. It contains information from various systems within an organisation.
Non-volatile: The data values in a database cannot be changed without a valid reason.
Time-variant: A data warehouse contains historical data for analysis.

Star Schema
Facts and dimensions are the two key elements of dimension modelling.
only some facts and dimensions are combined in a specific manner to build the structure of a data warehouse, called a schema diagram. 
A schema is an outline of the entire data warehouse. 
It shows how different data sets are connected and how the different attributes of each data set are used for the data warehouse.

In a star schema, Dimension table contains the metadata needed for analysing numerical/quantitative data.
