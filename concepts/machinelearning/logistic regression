sigmoid curve has all the properties you would want — extremely low values in the start, extremely high values in the end, and intermediate values in the middle — it’s a good choice for modelling the value of the probability of diabetes.

The main problem with a straight line is that it is not steep enough. In the sigmoid curve, as you can see, you have low values for a lot of points, then the values rise all of a sudden, after which you have a lot of high values. In a straight line though, the values rise from low to high very uniformly, and hence, the “boundary” region, the one where the probabilities transition from high to low is not present.
