code a TextPad with following functionality:

display() – to display the entire content
display(n, m) – to display from line n to m
insert(n, text) – to insert text at line n
delete(n) – delete line n
delete(n, m) – delete from line n to m
copy(n, m) – copy contents from line n to m to clipboard
paste(n) – paste contents from clipboard to line n
undo() – undo last command
redo() – redo last command
expected the textpad to be in memory(not as file) and also expected to handle error gracefully and the program to be menu driven.
