Low-Level Design of Product Category Manager
We will design a command line application for managing the catalog of product categories for an e-commerce platform. The application will allow an n-level hierarchy and support adding, moving, and getting product categories.

Requirements
Initialization: The application initializes with a default root product category named ALL_PRODUCTS.
Adding Product Category:
ADD_PRODUCT_CATEGORY <product_category_name> <parent_product_category_name>
Moving Product Category:
MOVE_PRODUCT_CATEGORY <product_category_name> <parent_product_category_name>
Getting Product Category:
GET_PRODUCT_CATEGORY <product_category_name>

Design
We'll use a tree-like structure to manage categories. Each category will have a unique name and a list of child categories. We'll use a dictionary to store references to categories by name for quick lookup.

Summary
This low-level design includes:

Interfaces: Define the essential operations for the category component.
Models: Represent categories using the Composite design pattern.
Initialization: The application initializes with a default root category.
Operations: Methods to add, move, and get product categories.
Class Diagram: Illustrates the relationships between classes.
Example Usage: Demonstrates how to use the designed system to manage product categories.
The Composite design pattern is particularly useful here to handle the hierarchical structure of product categories, ensuring that the system is easy to extend and maintain.
