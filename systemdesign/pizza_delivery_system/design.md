Define Models
We'll define models for User, Pizza, Order, and Delivery.

Create Interfaces
We'll define interfaces for the services required in the system: UserService, PizzaService, OrderService, and DeliveryService.

Implement Service Classes
We'll implement the concrete classes for these services using design patterns such as Singleton for the services and Factory for creating instances.

Singleton ensures a single instance of each service, and the Factory pattern (implicitly used through service methods) helps in managing the creation of objects.
