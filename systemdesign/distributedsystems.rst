Eventual consistency
Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in distributed systems, databases, and other distributed computing scenarios. 
In eventual consistency, updates to a data store propagate asynchronously to all replicas or nodes in the system, 
allowing different replicas to temporarily hold different views of the data. 
However, over time, these replicas converge and reach a consistent state, hence the term "eventual" consistency.

Here are some key points about eventual consistency:

Asynchronous Updates: 
In an eventually consistent system, updates (writes) to the data store are propagated asynchronously to all replicas. 
This means that after an update is made, it may take some time for all replicas to reflect that update.

Temporary Inconsistency: 
Due to the asynchronous nature of updates, different replicas may have different views of the data at any given point in time. 
This can lead to temporary inconsistencies where one replica has the updated data while another replica still has the old data.

Convergence: 
Despite the temporary inconsistencies, eventual consistency guarantees that all replicas will eventually converge to a consistent state. 
This convergence happens over time as updates are propagated and applied to all replicas.

Trade-off: 
Eventual consistency is often used in distributed systems because it offers benefits such as high availability, scalability, and low latency.
However, it comes with the trade-off of potential temporary inconsistencies, which applications and users must be able to tolerate or handle gracefully.

Conflict Resolution: 
In some cases, conflicts may arise when updates are made concurrently to different replicas. 
Conflict resolution mechanisms are used to resolve these conflicts and ensure eventual consistency.

Eventual consistency is commonly used in distributed databases (e.g., NoSQL databases like Cassandra, Riak) and 
distributed systems (e.g., cloud storage systems, content delivery networks) where strong consistency 
(e.g., strict consistency models like linearizability) may not be feasible or necessary for all use cases. 
It's important to design applications and systems with eventual consistency in mind, taking into account strategies for handling temporary
inconsistencies and resolving conflicts when they occur.
