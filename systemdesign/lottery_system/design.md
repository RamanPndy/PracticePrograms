Define Models

We'll define the following models:
User: Represents a participant in the lottery.
Lottery: Represents a lottery event.
Ticket: Represents a ticket purchased by a user.
Prize: Represents a prize in the lottery.

Define Interfaces

We'll define interfaces for the core functionalities of the lottery system:
LotteryService: Interface for managing lotteries.
TicketService: Interface for managing tickets.
PrizeService: Interface for managing prizes.
DrawService: Interface for performing the lottery draw.

Design patterns such as Dependency Injection can be easily integrated to manage dependencies between these components.
