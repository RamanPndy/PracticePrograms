Components:

User Management: Handles user registration, authentication, and user-related operations.
Expense Management: Handles creating and managing shared expenses among users.
Debt Management: Tracks and manages debts between users.
Notification System: Sends notifications to users about expense updates and settlement reminders.
Data Model:

User: Contains user information such as user ID, name, email, password, and contact details.
Expense: Represents a shared expense and contains information like expense ID, description, total amount, participants, and settlement status.
Debt: Tracks individual debts between users and includes information such as debtor ID, creditor ID, and the amount owed.
Notification: Stores notification details such as notification ID, recipient ID, content, timestamp, and status.
User Management:

Implement user registration and authentication mechanisms to allow users to create accounts and log in.
Store user information in a database, including details like name, email, password (hashed), and contact information.
Implement session management to maintain user sessions and ensure secure access to the system.
Expense Management:

Provide functionality to create a new expense, specifying the description, total amount, and participants involved.
Store the expense details in a database, associating it with the relevant users and generating a unique expense ID.
Implement operations to update and delete expenses, ensuring appropriate permission checks and validations.
Provide APIs to fetch and display expense details, including the participants, amount owed by each user, and settlement status.
Debt Management:

Calculate and update individual debts between users based on the expenses and settlements.
Maintain a record of all debts in a database, including debtor ID, creditor ID, and the amount owed.
Implement algorithms to simplify debts and minimize transactions during settlement operations.
Provide functionality to settle debts between users, updating the debt records and marking them as settled.
Notification System:

Design a notification system to keep users informed about expense updates, settlement reminders, and other relevant activities.
Create and store notifications in a database, associating them with the recipient user and relevant expense or debt.
Implement mechanisms to trigger notifications and deliver them to the intended users via email, push notifications, or other channels.
Handle user preferences for notification settings, such as opting in/out of specific types of notifications or preferred delivery channels.
Scalability and Performance:

Design the system with scalability in mind, ensuring that it can handle a large number of users, expenses, and debts.
Employ techniques like load balancing, caching, and database sharding to distribute the workload and improve performance.
Optimize database queries and indexes to efficiently fetch and update expense, debt, and notification data.
