Designing a system like Google Drive involves several key components, especially when dealing with uploading large files in chunks and ensuring data integrity in case of interruptions. Hereâ€™s a high-level design (HLD) focusing on these aspects:

### High-Level Design (HLD) of Google Drive

#### Key Components

1. **Client Application**: Interface for users to upload, download, and manage files.
2. **Chunk Manager**: Handles the logic for splitting files into chunks and managing their upload.
3. **Upload Service**: Receives file chunks from clients, performs validation, and stores them temporarily.
4. **Storage Service**: Manages the permanent storage of file chunks and their metadata.
5. **Database**: Stores metadata about files, users, and chunks, including information on upload progress and chunk hashes.
6. **Network Handler**: Manages connectivity issues, retry logic, and ensures data integrity.

#### File Upload Process

1. **File Splitting**:
   - The client application splits the file into smaller chunks.
   - Each chunk is assigned a unique identifier (chunk ID) and a hash for integrity verification.

2. **Upload Initialization**:
   - The client sends a request to the upload service to start a new file upload.
   - The upload service responds with an upload ID and details of the expected chunks.

3. **Uploading Chunks**:
   - The client starts uploading chunks to the upload service.
   - For each chunk, the client includes the chunk ID, upload ID, and hash.

4. **Chunk Storage**:
   - The upload service validates each chunk (e.g., checks the hash) and stores it in temporary storage.
   - Metadata about the uploaded chunk (e.g., chunk ID, upload ID, hash) is saved in the database.

5. **Upload Completion**:
   - Once all chunks are uploaded, the client sends a completion request.
   - The upload service verifies all chunks are received and match their hashes.
   - The chunks are then assembled into the final file in permanent storage.

#### Handling Internet Issues

1. **Checkpointing**:
   - During the upload process, the client periodically sends progress updates to the upload service.
   - The service logs which chunks have been successfully uploaded.

2. **Resuming Uploads**:
   - If the internet connection drops, the client pauses the upload.
   - When the connection is restored, the client queries the upload service for the current status of the upload (using the upload ID).

3. **Chunk Verification**:
   - The upload service responds with the list of successfully uploaded chunks.
   - The client cross-references this list with its local records.

4. **Integrity Checks**:
   - For each chunk in the list, the client verifies the hash to ensure data integrity.
   - If a mismatch is found, the client re-uploads the affected chunk.

5. **Continuation**:
   - The client resumes uploading any remaining chunks, ensuring no duplicates or missing parts.
   - The process continues until all chunks are successfully uploaded and verified.

```

### Additional Considerations

1. **Security**: Use secure channels (e.g., HTTPS) for all communications. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can upload/download files.

2. **Scalability**: Ensure the upload and storage services can scale horizontally to handle large volumes of concurrent uploads.

3. **Redundancy**: Implement redundancy and replication strategies to ensure data durability and availability.

4. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement monitoring for upload progress, error rates, and system performance. Set up alerts for any anomalies.

This design ensures efficient, reliable, and secure handling of file uploads, even in the face of intermittent connectivity issues.
