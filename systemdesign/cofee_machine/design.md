To design a coffee machine system, we'll follow a low-level design approach with Python, focusing on interfaces, models, and the implementation of the Factory design pattern. We'll also provide a class diagram and use-case diagram to illustrate the design.

Requirements
CoffeeMachine: Main class to interact with the system.
Beverages: Different types of beverages (e.g., Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino).
Ingredients: Different types of ingredients (e.g., Water, Milk, Coffee Beans).
Inventory: Manages the stock of ingredients.
Factory Pattern: To create different types of beverages.

Summary
This low-level design includes the following components:

Interfaces: Define the essential operations for beverages, inventory, and the coffee machine.
Models: Represent the beverages and inventory in the coffee machine.
Factory Pattern: Used to create different types of beverages.
Class Diagram: Illustrates the relationships between classes.
Use-Case Diagram: Describes the interactions between the user and the coffee machine.
The Factory design pattern is particularly useful here to handle the creation of different types of beverages, ensuring that the system is easy to extend and maintain.
