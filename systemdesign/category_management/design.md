The product management system will support multiple categories, each with multiple subcategories, and products within those categories and subcategories. We'll use the Composite design pattern to manage the hierarchical structure of categories and subcategories.

Requirements
Category: Represents a product category which can contain subcategories or products.
Subcategory: A category that exists within another category.
Product: Represents a product with specific details.
Composite Pattern: Used to handle the hierarchical structure of categories and subcategories.

Summary
This low-level design includes:

Interfaces: Define the operations for category components.
Models: Represent categories, subcategories, and products.
Composite Pattern: Used to handle the hierarchical structure of categories and subcategories.
Class Diagram: Illustrates the relationships between classes.
Use-Case Diagram: Describes the interactions between the admin and the system.
The Composite design pattern is particularly useful here to manage the hierarchical structure of categories and subcategories, ensuring that the system is easy to extend and maintain.
