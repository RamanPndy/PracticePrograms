Users: Users can register, search for rides, book rides, and offer rides.
Cars: Users can register their cars.
Rides: Users can create, search, book, and cancel rides.
Payments: Users can make and receive payments for rides.

The Singleton pattern is used for user registration to ensure a single instance of user registry, and the Factory pattern is used for ride creation to encapsulate the instantiation logic. Each service (User, Car, Ride, Payment) implements its respective interface, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and easy extensibility.
