Low-Level Design of Dropbox System
We will design a system similar to Dropbox which allows users to manage their files and folders. The design will include functionalities like adding, moving, and retrieving files and folders. We'll also ensure that the system supports a hierarchical structure similar to a filesystem.

Requirements
Initialization: The system initializes with a default root folder named ROOT.
Adding Files/Folders:
ADD_FILE <file_name> <parent_folder_name>
ADD_FOLDER <folder_name> <parent_folder_name>
Moving Files/Folders:
MOVE <item_name> <new_parent_folder_name>
Getting Files/Folders:
GET <item_name>
Design
We'll use a tree-like structure to manage files and folders. Each file and folder will have a unique name and a list of children (if itâ€™s a folder). We'll use a dictionary to store references to files and folders by name for quick lookup.

Summary
This low-level design includes:

Interfaces: Define the essential operations for the file system components.
Models: Represent files and folders using the Composite design pattern.
Initialization: The application initializes with a default root folder.
Operations: Methods to add, move, and get files and folders.
Class Diagram: Illustrates the relationships between classes.
Example Usage: Demonstrates how to use the designed system to manage files and folders.
The Composite design pattern is particularly useful here to handle the hierarchical structure of files and folders, ensuring that the system is easy to extend and maintain.
