To create a low-level design for a system like Truecaller, we need to focus on the key functionalities: caller identification, call blocking, and spam detection. The design should include interfaces, models, and implementation of design patterns. We'll use the Observer and Strategy patterns for different parts of the system.

Key Functionalities
Caller Identification
Call Blocking
Spam Detection

Design Patterns
Observer Pattern: For updating subscribers when a call is identified.
Strategy Pattern: For different spam detection algorithms.
