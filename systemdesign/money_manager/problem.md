Design an expense splitting and balance simplification system in python
Any individual user can add the expense and for that user ledger has to be maintained at global level.
expense could be equal, exact and percentage type
Group can be created and n each group, there could be multiple payee 
there would be balance sheet where all transactions will be captured for each user
balance sheet will show all the transactions along with group wise transactions
for example, if 2 user spends on multiple categories then their individual and category wise transactions should be recorded.
define interfaces, design patterns, service class and persistence layer.

Design Patterns
Factory Pattern: To create different types of expenses.
Singleton Pattern: For a single instance of the balance sheet to maintain the state.
