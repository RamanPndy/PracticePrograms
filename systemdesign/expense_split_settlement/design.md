To design a system that handles the settlement of amounts among multiple payees and participants for shared expenses, we'll use a low-level design approach with Python, focusing on models, interfaces, and basic functionalities. Hereâ€™s how you can structure such a system:

Requirements and Assumptions
Participants: Users involved in the expense sharing.
Payees: Users who paid the expense.
Expense: Total amount to be settled among participants.
Settlement: Calculating and recording settlements among participants.

Explanation
Participant Class: Represents a participant with an ID and name.
Payee Class: Represents a payee who paid a specific amount.
Expense Class: Represents the total expense to be settled among participants.
SettlementService Interface: Defines a method to calculate settlements.
EqualSettlementService Class: Implements the SettlementService interface to calculate settlements equally among participants based on the amounts paid by payees.
Usage Example: Demonstrates how to create participants, payees, and an expense, and then calculate settlements using the EqualSettlementService.
