Designing a chess board game involves creating models for the board, pieces, and game logic, as well as interfaces for the essential operations. We'll use the Strategy design pattern to handle different types of movements for the chess pieces.

Requirements
Board: Represents the chessboard.
Pieces: Different types of chess pieces (e.g., King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, Pawn).
Game: Manages the state of the game.
Movement: Handles the movement logic for the pieces.
Strategy Pattern: Used to encapsulate the movement logic for each type of piece.

Summary
This low-level design includes the following components:

Interfaces: Define the essential operations for the board and pieces.
Models: Represent the chess pieces and the board.
Strategy Pattern: Used to handle the movement logic for each type of piece.
Class Diagram: Illustrates the relationships between classes.
Use-Case Diagram: Describes the interactions between the player and the game.
The Strategy design pattern is particularly useful here to encapsulate the movement logic for different types of pieces, ensuring that the system is easy to extend and maintain.
