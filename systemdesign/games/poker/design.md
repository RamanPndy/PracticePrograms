Designing a low-level online card game like poker involves managing game states, player interactions, and game history while ensuring that scores and statuses are updated in real-time. Below is a detailed design, including interfaces, models, and the implementation of the Observer design pattern for notifying players of game updates. We'll also include a class diagram and use cases to illustrate the design.

Requirements

Game Management:
Manage multiple poker games.
Display scores and game statuses.
Maintain game history.

Player Management:
Players can join or leave games.
Players receive updates on game status and scores.

Notification System:
Notify players about game updates (scores, status changes).

Design Considerations
Game: Represents a poker game with attributes like players, scores, and status.
Player: Represents a player participating in the game.
GameHistory: Records the history of game events.
Notification System: Implements the Observer pattern to notify players about game updates.

Summary
This design includes:

Interfaces: IGameSubject and IPlayerObserver define operations for game subjects and observers.
Models: Game and Player implementing the subject and observer respectively.
Additional Components: GameHistory to keep track of game events.
Operations: Methods to create games, add/remove players, and update scores and statuses.
Class Diagram: Illustrates relationships between classes using the Observer pattern.
Use Cases: Scenarios for creating games, adding players, and updating scores and statuses.
The Observer pattern ensures that players receive real-time updates about the game status and scores, enhancing the interactivity and responsiveness of the online poker system.
