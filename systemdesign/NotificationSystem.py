'''
In this example, we have a Notification class representing a single notification with recipient, 
content, timestamp, and status. The NotificationService class handles the processing of notifications. 
It uses a Queue to store pending notifications and creates multiple worker threads to process them 
asynchronously. The NotificationService also provides a send_notification method to enqueue new 
notifications for processing.
