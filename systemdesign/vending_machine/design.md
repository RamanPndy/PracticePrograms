Designing a vending machine system involves several components including the items in the vending machine, payment mechanisms, inventory management, and user interactions. We'll design the system with interfaces, models, and an implementation of the State design pattern to manage the state transitions of the vending machine.

Requirements
Items: Products available in the vending machine.
Inventory: Manages the stock of items.
Payments: Handles payment processing.
User Interface: Facilitates user interactions.
State Management: Manages different states of the vending machine (e.g., idle, selecting, dispensing, out of stock).

Summary
This low-level design includes the following components:

Interfaces: Define the essential operations for items, inventory, payments, user interface, and state management.
Models: Represent the items and inventory in the vending machine.
State Pattern: Manages the state transitions of the vending machine through various states like idle, selecting, payment, dispensing, and out-of-stock.
The State design pattern is particularly useful here to handle the different states and transitions of the vending machine, ensuring that the system is easy to extend and maintain.
